Please, strongly consider posting your question to Stack Overflow. The purpose of this issue tracker is to track bugs and feature requests. Questions on how to use the library should be posted to stack overflow so that everyone can benefit from your question.

If you really need to post your question here:
1. Please be super clear on what you're trying to achieve. What is the expected result?
2. Please outline what you've tried. There is no point us suggesting something you've already tried.
3. Outline the things that have failed, based on your past attempts. This will help us to diagnose whether we need to add a feature or whether it is a bug.

Thanks!
